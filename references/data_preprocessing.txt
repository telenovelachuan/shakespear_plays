- load processed dataset, with explorative features added, into Pandas
- for numeric features:
  1. use imputer that fills median values
  2. use StandardScaler to normalize feature values
- for categorical features: use one hot encoding to encode feature values
- split train/test data via random shuffling
- drop Player column to form training data
- for Keras Dense Neural Network, one-hot encode the label in advance and transform to matrix
